				<p class="intro_text2"> Developed in England in the 19th century, they were originally bred to assist gamekeepers in guarding estates against poachers. Their lineage includes a mix of English Mastiffs and Bulldogs, which contributes to their distinctive traits.One of the defining features of Bullmastiffs is their size. They are large and powerful dogs, with adult males typically weighing between 110 to 130 pounds (50 to 59 kg), and females weighing slightly less at 100 to 120 pounds (45 to 54 kg). Their solid build and strong muscles give them an imposing presence.Despite their size, Bullmastiffs are known for their gentle and affectionate nature with their families. They form deep bonds with their owners and are often described as loving and devoted. They are great with children and can be highly protective, making them excellent family pets. However, their protective instincts can sometimes lead to wariness around strangers, making early socialization and proper training essential.</p>
