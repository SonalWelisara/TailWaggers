						<p class="intro_text">Guppy fish, also known as millionfish, are a popular choice for aquarium enthusiasts due to their vibrant colors and active behavior. Here are some key facts to consider when caring for guppy fish:
												Size: Guppies are small fish, typically growing to only 1-2 inches in length. This makes them suitable for smaller tanks.
												Lifespan: With proper care, guppies can live for up to 2-3 years.
												Behavior: Guppies are active swimmers and enjoy exploring their environment. They are also social animals and do best when kept in groups of four or more.
												Water temperature: Guppies are tropical fish and require a water temperature between 72-82 degrees Fahrenheit.
												Tank decoration: Guppies enjoy having plenty of places to hide and explore in their tank. Adding plants, rocks, and other decorations can provide them with a stimulating environment.
												Water quality: Guppies are sensitive to changes in water quality and require regular water changes to maintain a healthy environment. It is important to test the water regularly for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.
												Feeding: Guppies are omnivores and require a varied diet that includes both commercial fish food and fresh vegetables. Overfeeding can lead to health problems, so it is important to feed them only what they can eat in a few minutes.
												Breeding: Guppies are known for their prolific breeding habits and can quickly populate a tank if left unchecked.
