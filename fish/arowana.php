									Arowana fish are a highly prized species known for their striking appearance and unique behavior. Native to South America, Asia, and Australia, these fish are often kept as pets in home aquariums.
									One of the most distinctive features of arowana fish is their long, sleek bodies and large scales that shimmer like precious metals. They come in a variety of colors, including silver, gold, red, and green, and are often referred to as "dragon fish" due to their resemblance to the mythical creature.
									Arowana fish are also known for their jumping ability, which they use to catch prey in the wild. This behavior can be dangerous in captivity, as they may jump out of their tanks if not properly secured.
									In addition to their aesthetic appeal, arowana fish are valued for their intelligence and social behavior. They are known to form strong bonds with their owners and can recognize individual people.
									However, arowana fish require specific water conditions and a well-maintained tank to thrive. They are also prone to certain diseases and parasites, so proper care is essential for their health.
									Overall, arowana fish are a fascinating and unique species that require specialized care but offer a rewarding experience for dedicated owners.
									Arowana are carnivorous and require a diet of live or frozen foods such as shrimp, crickets, and small fish.
									They are known for their ability to jump out of the water, so a tight-fitting lid is necessary to prevent escape.

				Guppies are also known for their unique and beautiful tails, which come in a variety of shapes and colors. They are a peaceful fish and can coexist with other non-aggressive species in a community tank. Guppies are also popular for their ability to adapt to different water conditions, making them a hardy and resilient species. With proper care, guppy fish can provide years of enjoyment and entertainment for their owners.
				It is important to separate males and females if you do not want them to breed.
				Overall, guppy fish are a great choice for beginner aquarium enthusiasts due to their small size, easy care requirements, and vibrant colors.
				Overall, arowana are not recommended for beginner fish keepers due to their size and specific care requirements. They require a significant investment in time, space, and money, but can be rewarding pets for experienced hobbyists.
