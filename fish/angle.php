							Angelfish are a popular freshwater fish that belong to the cichlid family. They are native to the Amazon Basin in South America and are known for their unique shape and striking colors. Here are some key facts about angelfish:

							There are three species of angelfish: the common angelfish, the altum angelfish, and the scalare angelfish. The most commonly kept species in aquariums is the scalare angelfish.
							Angelfish can grow up to 6 inches in length and have a triangular body shape with long, flowing fins.
							They come in a variety of colors, including silver, black, and gold, and may have stripes or spots on their bodies.
							Angelfish are omnivores and will eat a variety of foods, including flakes, pellets, and live or frozen foods such as brine shrimp or bloodworms.
							They are peaceful fish that can be kept with other non-aggressive species in a community tank.
							Angelfish require a well-maintained aquarium with plenty of hiding places and plants to provide them with security and shelter.
							They prefer warm water with a temperature range of 75-82°F and a pH between 6.0-7.5.
							Angelfish are known for their breeding behavior, which involves the male and female pair bonding and laying their eggs on a flat surface.

							Overall, angelfish make beautiful and peaceful additions to any aquarium. With proper care and attention, they can live for up to 10 years or more.
